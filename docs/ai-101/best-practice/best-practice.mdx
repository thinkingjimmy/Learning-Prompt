ChatGPT has been around for over six months now. When it first launched, many were amazed by the capabilities of AI. Some even thought it would replace human jobs.

But after the initial hype died down, it seems AI hasn't replaced as many human roles as expected. In fact, I’ve noticed many people, including myself, using AI less frequently after the novelty wore off.

Upon reflection, I realized the issue may not be with the AI itself, but with our imagination 😂. There are still many creative ways we can use AI that have yet to be explored. Tasks that were tedious before could improve 10x with the right AI application - we just need to spread awareness of these use cases.

To help everyone use AI more effectively, I've created this "AI Best Practices" section to share practical and interesting AI applications. Hope you enjoy!
