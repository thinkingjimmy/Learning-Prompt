## 😎 About this tutorial

This tutorial has three parts. The content covers my journey of learning Prompt Engineering, summarizing some of the experiences and methods. If you are learning Prompt Engineering, I hope this tutorial can help.

1. [AI 101](https://learningprompt.wiki/docs/ai-101): An AI tutorial for everyone. Still working hard on it. Stay tuned.
2. [ChatGPT Tutorial](https://learningprompt.wiki/docs/chatgpt-learning-path): From basics to advanced, from a user's perspective, this teaches you how to use ChatGPT and how to use it even better.
3. [Midjourney Tutorial](https://learningprompt.wiki/docs/midjourney-learning-path): Through various examples, this teaches you how to use Midjourney. Even as a beginner, after reading this, you'll be able to quickly get started.

What this is not:

- This is not a prompt collection. If you're expecting to find prompts to use directly, I'd recommend Googling instead. This focuses more on teaching methods and explaining why they work.
- This is not meant as an authoritative guide. In this field, I'm also a student.

## How to read?

Thanks for opening this tutorial. When reading it, I suggest:

1. **Lower expectations: ** I'm no expert. I'm learning too, just a few steps ahead of you. There may be gaps or errors here. Also, for beginners, analogies or terms may be dumbed down a bit to aid understanding. Please be tolerant.
2. **Feedback is welcomed: ** If parts don't make sense or seem wrong, please raise an issue or use the form. Let's improve together and contribute to furthering PE.
3. **Learn by doing: ** The best way is hands-on practice. There are examples to try as you read. Even better, share prompts you write via issues/forms. I'll add good ones to the doc.

I believe the best way to learn is by doing. So try the examples in ChatGPT or Midjourney. It'll help cement the concepts.

You'll see these emojis:

- 🚧 : Contents need more work but don't affect reading. I'll improve later.
- 🆘 : I need help here, e.g. prompt examples for a scenario. Ideas welcome via issues/Discord.
- 🔴 : To prep you for advanced sections, basics may mention advanced concepts. No need to dive deep yet.
